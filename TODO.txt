TODO List
--------------------

THE GAME
--------------------
[-] Bug fixing on the game
	[X] Apply layers to the game
		=> Config order is what matters (but moving images should be upper)
	[-] Red Blocks doesn't disappear when destroyed
		=> check animations
	[-] Red power go through walls when used too early
		=> add a timer to avoid that problem
	[-] Music doesn't loop and transition in shifting not subtle enough
		=> Do Loop
		=> Lower the sound for a smoother transition 
[-] Conception (maybe) problems
	[-] No limit even when no screen (and no scrolling)
[-] In progress (but not now)
	[-] Object Rotation
---------------------

	[X] When changing screens, the objects of the previous one doesn't disappear
		=> add removeAllChildren to ClearCanvas() (Systemize ?)
	[X] World View isn't working
	[X] Fixing the saving fonction
		=> the layers properties needed to be set to undefined
